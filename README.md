A note-taking web application built with React.js. It does not include a database, so data will not persist between sessions.
This project was created to learn and practice key concepts of React.js frontend development.

To run the application:
1. Clone the keepr-web-app repository.
2. Run the command 'npm i' to install all necessary npm dependencies.
3. Execute 'npm run dev' to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to the local HTTP address displayed in the console after running the 'npm run dev' command.
